I want to thank you for stopping by. This message may find its way into an `About` page sometime in the future. We're really excited to be building some momentum around [Serverless Academy](http://www.serverlessacademy.com)! Please let me set some focus for this blog so you'll know what to expect.

**We deepy care about our community**. Therefore, any time we see outstanding developments in and around the serverless space, we want to share!

**We are excited about what we're doing**. Therefore, we want to recap the progress in a show-and-tell fashion! Whether we are developing a blog deployment pipeline or something even more ambitious, we want to do it all in the open for you learn with us.

**We are sensitive to how you learn**. Therefore, we want to publish our content in a couple of different formats: **video** and **text**. Sometimes you just need to see someone else do "it" before "it" clicks in your mind.

I'll wrap up by giving you an idea of our production schedule. I anticipate a Monday-Wednesday-Friday cadence. This cadence will begin before the blog goes live and can be found in [our repo](https://github.com/linuxacademy/serverless-blog) even before the site launches. We're glad you're part of this! Keep in touch!
